// React components follow the PascalCase naming convention. Knowing this will help you quickly identify whether a function is a component or just a regular function

// IF ELSE IN REACT
    // The shorthand condition is called a ternary operator, identified with the ? and : symbols. The ternary operator is a popular pattern in React to enable conditional rendering, similar to how we used the && operator as a short circuit. With the ternary, though, we supply the false condition to render as well.

// <> and </> that wrap the Gallery and About components
    // They are called React fragmentsâ€”a shorthand abbreviation for <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
    // allow multiple elements to be grouped together
    //  Although in JSX you can only return a single parent element, this rule can be satisfied by wrapping the children components in a React fragment. This also allows you to wrap elements without creating extra DOM nodes, like wrapping with a <div> would do
