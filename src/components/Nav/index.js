// Whenever we map over anything in JSX, the outermost element must have a key attribute that's set to be something unique. This helps React keep track of items in the virtual DOM
// In this case, we used category.name because we don't expect any categories to share the same name. Often the key will be an id
// Note also the use of parentheses in the map callback to return JSX. When you map over an array in a JSX expression, you should return only a single JSX elementâ€”like how you can only return a single element from a React component.

// use built in onClick() function

// The onClick() attribute is expecting a callback function declaration. It's important that we wrap it in a function declaration rather than just calling categorySelected(category.name), which would cause the function to get called whenever the component renders as well
