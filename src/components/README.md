The standard practice for components --> file name is capitalized and is named after the component it is referencing!

Need at the top
- import React from 'react';

Create a constant the same name as the component file

JSX
- JavaScript XML
- makes react easier to write

You import components into App.js file to use

React components must always return a single parent JSX element. However, this element may have many children elements.

You can use the {} syntax in JSX to use JavaScript
You've seen template literals and handlebars {} used to employ JavaScript in strings or HTML. This is one more flavor of JavaScript in HTML. In addition to referencing variables, you can also use JavaScript expressions.
